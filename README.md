Integrates Notion's [API](https://developers.notion.com/) with the [XML API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) provided by BGG. Please follow the first two steps [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs) to create a Notion secret and find the database ID. 

## TODO
- [x] Download the collections from BGG to a Notion database.
- [ ] Update contens on BGG website when changes are made in the Notion database.
- [ ] Update contens in the Notion databse when changes are made on BGG website.

*Basically create a two way sync between the Notion database and the BGG website.*
